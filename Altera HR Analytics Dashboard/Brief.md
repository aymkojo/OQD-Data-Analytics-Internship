Human Resource Analytics Project 1
Analyzing Altera Employee Data.
Business Task 
Objective: Develop a Simple HR Analytics Dashboard that provides insightful 
reporting on the workforce of the organization. The dashboard should serve as a 
decision-support tool highlighting key metrics and performance indicators.


Key Deliverables:
1. Total Employees: Implement a widget that displays the current total number 
of employees within the organization.
2. Employment Type Breakdown: Create a chart that compares the number of 
full-time employees to part-time employees, offering insight into employment 
structures.
3. Employee Recruitment Channels: Determining Employee Recruitment 
Channels can be pivotal for several aspects of human resources and 
organizational strategy. Assess which recruitment channels bring in the highest 
number of successful candidates. If applicable, success can be measured in terms 
of candidates who pass interviews, are offered jobs, and accept those offers.
4. Gender Distribution: Generate visualizations such as pie charts or bar graphs 
that represent the distribution of employees by gender across the company.
5. Department Overview: Construct charts that visualize the number of 
employees within each department, facilitating a clear understanding of 
manpower allocation.
6. Location Distribution: If applicable, integrate a section that breaks down the 
number of employees by their geographic location to display workforce 
distribution.
7. Training Metrics: Represent the total number of trainings completed companywide and provide a breakdown of training participation by department.
8. Awards and Recognition: Design visuals that highlight the number of awards 
won, segmented by department and gender, to showcase areas of excellence.
9. Employee Age Distribution: Create an age distribution histogram or similar 
graph to analyze the demographic composition of the workforce.
10.Gender-Based Ratings and Experience: Develop visualizations that correlate 
gender with performance ratings and levels of experience within the 
organization.
11.Education Level: Exhibit a chart that categorizes the number of employees 
according to their highest level of education completed.
12.Performance Metrics: Include key performance indicators such as ‘KPIs met’, 
‘average training scores’, and ‘ratings’ to give insight into the performance 
landscape of the employees.
13.Length of Service: How long has an employee being in the organization?



   
Data Handling: You are expected to utilize the provided dataset, ensuring data 
accuracy and relevance. Handling of missing data, data cleansing, and preparation 
should be conducted as preliminary steps before visualization.
Interactivity and Usability: The dashboard should be interactive, allowing users to 
filter by different categories like department, location, gender, and education levels. It 
should also be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that non-technical stakeholders can 
make sense of the data presented.
Reporting and Presentation: The final dashboard should be presented with a brief 
report explaining the design choices, insights gathered from the visualizations, and 
recommendations for decision-makers based on the data.


Evaluation Criteria:
• Accuracy of data representation.
• Aesthetic and clarity of visualizations.
• Relevance and usefulness of the insights provided.
