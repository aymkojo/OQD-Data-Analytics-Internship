Business Problem 
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this case study, 
you’ll analyze a dataset from a telecom company called Vertex Mobile. 
The manager has concluded that it is time to make fundamental changes in customer retention

For these reasons, we will analyze customer data to track customer attrition rate so that we can help 
adjust the company policies and thus keep the customers happy as they use the company’s 
telecom services.
